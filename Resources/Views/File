<h4>8. Data protection provisions about the application and use of StackOverflow</h4>
<p>On this website, the controller has integrated components of StackOverflow. Stack Overflow is a privately held website, the flagship site of the Stack Exchange Network, created in 2008 by Jeff Atwood and Joel Spolsky. It was created to be a more open alternative to earlier question and answer sites such as Experts-Exchange. The name for the website was chosen by voting in April 2008 by readers of Coding Horror, Atwood's popular programming blog.</p>

<p>The operating company of StackOverflow is StackOverflow New York
110 William Street
28th Floor
New York, NY 10038</p>

<p>With each call-up to one of the individual pages of this Internet site, which is operated by the controller and on which a StackOverflow component (StackOverflow button) was integrated, the Internet browser on the information technology system of the data subject is automatically prompted to download a display of the corresponding StackOverflow component of StackOverflow. During the course of this technical procedure, StackOverflow gains knowledge of what specific sub-page of our website was visited by the data subject. The purpose of the integration of the StackOverflow component is a retransmission of the contents of this website to allow our users to introduce this web page to the digital world and increase our visitor numbers.</p>

<p>If the data subject is logged in at the same time on StackOverflow, StackOverflow detects with every call-up to our website by the data subject and for the entire duration of their stay on our Internet site which specific sub-page of our Internet page was visited by the data subject. This information is collected through the StackOverflow component and associated with the respective StackOverflow account of the data subject. If the data subject clicks on one of the StackOverflow buttons integrated on our website, then StackOverflow assigns this information to the personal StackOverflow user account of the data subject and stores the personal data.</p>

<p>StackOverflow receives information via the StackOverflow component that the data subject has visited our website, provided that the data subject is logged in on StackOverflow at the time of the call-up to our website. This occurs regardless of whether the person clicks on the StackOverflow component or not. If such a transmission of information to StackOverflow is not desirable for the data subject, then he or she may prevent this by logging off from their StackOverflow account before a call-up to our website is made.</p>
